<p>We are <strong>Nucleo Journalism</strong>, a data-driven website that publishes investigations and analysis about public spending, politics, social media debates and human rights in Brazil.</p>

<p>Our journalism is for everyone, but our main target audience are civil servants, third sector workers, journalists and people with keen interest in transparency, government accountibility and social media analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Nucleo</strong> (which in Portuguese means <em>core</em>) was founded in January 2020 by journalists <a href="https://twitter.com/sergiospagnuolo">SÃ©rgio Spagnuolo</a> (ex. Reuters, UN, ICFJ) and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexorrico">Alexandre Orrico</a> (ex. Buzzfeed, Folha de S.Paulo), with a small funding from them. We have five people currently collaborating with us in reporting, analysis and design.</p>

<p>We are actively looking for funding from people and institutions interested in supporting serious, evidence-based independent journalism. Our only requirements to receive any outside money are that we can disclose the funderâ€™s name and value invested, and that we maintain our journalistic authonomy.</p>

<h2 id="our-work">OUR WORK</h2>

<p>For now, our work is only published in Portuguese, but we do plan to have cross-border projects that can deliver multi-language reporting in the future.</p>

<p>Our reporting has been either feature in major news organizations or served as reference for them. One of our very first stories was used to inform a Congressional investigation about a major oil spill in Northeast Brazil, while another one was quoted in a multi-NGO inquiry in the Brazilian Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We try our best to map the impact we have on our audience and society in <a href="impacto">this page</a> (Portuguese-only).</p>
