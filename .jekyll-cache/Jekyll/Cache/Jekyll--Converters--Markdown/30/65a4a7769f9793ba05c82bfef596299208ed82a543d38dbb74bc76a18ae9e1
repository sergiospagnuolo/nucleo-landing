<p>We are Nucleo Journalism, a data-driven website that publishes investigations and analysis about public spending, politics, social media debates and human rights.</p>

<p>Our journalism is for everyone, but our main target are civil servants, third sector workers, journalists and people with keen interest in transparency and government accountibility.</p>

<p>Nucleo (which in Portuguese means â€˜coreâ€™) was founded in January 2020 by journalists SÃ©rgio Spagnuolo (ex. Reuters, UN, ICFJ) and Alexandre Orrico (ex. Buzzfeed, Folha de S.Paulo), with a small funding from them.</p>

<p>Since then, we are actively looking for interested parties interested in promoting and funding serious, evidence-based independent journalism. Our only requirements to receive any outside money are that we can disclose the funderâ€™s name and value invested, and that we maintain our journalistic authonomy.</p>

<h2 id="our-work">OUR WORK</h2>

<p>For now, our work is only published in Portuguese, but we do plan to have cross-border projects that can deliver multi-language reporting in the future.</p>
