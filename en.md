We are **Nucleo Journalism**, a data-driven website that publishes investigations and analysis about public spending, politics, social media debates and human rights in Brazil.

Our journalism is for everyone, but our main target audience are civil servants, third sector workers, journalists and people with keen interest in transparency, government accountibility and social media analysis.

**Nucleo** (which in Portuguese means _core_) was founded in January 2020 by journalists [SÃ©rgio Spagnuolo](https://twitter.com/sergiospagnuolo) (ex. Reuters, UN, ICFJ) and [Alexandre Orrico](https://twitter.com/alexorrico) (ex. Buzzfeed, Folha de S.Paulo), with a small funding from them.

We have five people currently collaborating with us in reporting, analysis and design.

## FUNDING

We are actively looking for funding right now, from people and institutions interested in supporting serious, evidence-based independent journalism.

Our basic requirements for receiving any outside money are: 1. we have to be able to disclose the funder's name and value invested or donated, and 2. we maintain our journalistic authonomy.

For now, to support ourselves, we license our unique content to partners in Brazil, like fact-checking agency [Aos Fatos](www.aosfatos.org), [Yahoo! News Brazil](https://br.noticias.yahoo.com/) and [Brazilian Report](https://brazilian.report/).

<br>

## OUR WORK

For now, our work is only published in Portuguese, but we do plan to have cross-border projects that can deliver multi-language reporting in the future.

Our reporting has been either feature in major news organizations or served as reference for them. One of our very first stories was used to inform a Congressional investigation about a major oil spill in Northeast Brazil, while another one was quoted in a multi-NGO inquiry in the Brazilian Supreme Court.

We try our best to map the impact we have on our audience and society in [this page](impacto) (Portuguese-only).
